# generator-an

Generates browserify friendly angular applications. As any other yeoman generator this generator is very much opinionated. 
# usage

```
yo an appName
npm install
gulp
```

This will scaffold an angular app:

* [`browserify`](http://browserify.org/) as code organization;
* [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/) as a build tool;
* [`bootstrap`](http://getbootstrap.com/) as css framework (only `less` part of it is used);
* [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape) as a test harness;
* [`zuul`](https://github.com/defunctzombie/zuul) as test runner
